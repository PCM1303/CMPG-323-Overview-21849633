## Branching Stratergy
I might create branches for some of the projects inorder to avoid making mistakes on the main project. 

## Gitignore Strategy
The .gitignore might be used if there are some portions of my work that I do not want to share or make available on my github profile.

## Sensitive information  Storage
The information will be stored safely in cloud(AZURE) andthe file name will be includec int the .gitignore.
